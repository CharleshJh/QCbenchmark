The files in /qasm have been taken from

https://github.com/iic-jku/ibm_qx_mapping

https://github.com/deeptechlabs/quantum_compiler_optim/tree/master/examples

-

The files in /Qis_qasm have taken from

The files in /Representative are used in papers like:

1. Exact Global Reordering for Nearest Neighbor Quantum Circuits Using A\* (2017)

   DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-59936-6_15

2. Efficient Construction of QMDDs for Irreversible, Reversible, and Quantum Functions (2017)

   DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-59936-6_17

3. Design of Efficient Quantum Circuits Using Nearest Neighbor Constraint in 2D Architecture (2017)

   DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-59936-6_19


And the files in /Representative_qasm are those files in /Representative transform general Toffoli into CCX
